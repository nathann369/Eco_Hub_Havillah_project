									<p>The Earth’s climate is changing and the scientific consensus concludes that by altering the composition of the atmosphere, humans are increasing the average temperature of the Earth's surface. This process has already begun; 
										the planet is measurably warmer than it was at the start of the last century.
										However, scientists predict the change that will occur over the 21st century 
										will be even greater. This increase will have unpredictable impacts on weather patterns 
										around the globe. We are all experiencing climate change. Our descendants will likely experience far more.
										Rather than feeling overwhelmed and powerless in the face of rising temperatures and their
										 potentially catastrophic consequences, find out what is actually happening and how you can play a part in safeguarding our world for generations to come. Do you want to learn more?

									What is Sustainability?
									<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
								</button>
								<div>
									<p>The term, sustainability can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

										Sustainability is aimed at integrating three dimensions which are economic, environmental, and social (also socio-political).
										
										Sustainability can be achieved in the following ways:
										
										- Physically - through the equitable supply of human and ecological goods and services.
										- Aspirationally - through making available the widespread means for advancement through access to education, systems of justice, and healthcare.
										- Strategically - through safeguarding the interests of generations to come.

									About Conservation?
									<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
								</button>
								<div>
									<p>We’ve observed that the conservation sector is beginning to make a deliberate effort to engage young people. Young people are, after all, due to inherit the earth. It is the nature of the earth to be inherited, however, which makes youth engagement more important now than at any time in history.

										The diagnostic refrains are familiar by now: the earth is ailing; we are in a global environmental crisis; the planet is at a crossroads. There is a need to build a stronger constituency of young people for conservation to face the mounting challenges in the future; to recognize the unique skills and perspectives that younger generations offer due to their uptake and contributions to various levers of global change, such as technological innovation and social media; and to incorporate young people’s solutions now so that we secure a sense of ownership over actions which protect the integrity of the earth into the future.
										
										In recognition of this, initiatives have been sprouting up across the globe which aim to invest in young professionals’ leadership on the environmental issues of our time. Yet, there is some inertia. Institutions supporting environmental conservation have historically been technocratic, hierarchical, and gerontocratic. The legacy lingers. The overall gains that are being made in developing young professionals’ environmental leadership can be described as surface-level.
										
										We envisage conservation being driven by dynamic, intergenerational leadership, which provides more innovative, more effective, more relevant, and a greater number of solutions to global, regional, national, and local environmental problems. We envisage institutions promoting environmental conservation that have a deep understanding of the value of intergenerational leadership and provide the cultural, physical, and financial infrastructure to support it.</p>

									About The School Climate Clubs?
									<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
								</button>
								<div>
									<p>The School Climate Club was initiated in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG-13), Climate Action because we believe in the power of schools to change the world.

										Justification for the establishment of the School Climate Clubs
										
											Climate change is a global problem that is somewhat impersonal and abstract to young people whose future is more greatly affected than anyone else. There is a need to reach these young ones, and get them interested in the climate issues in a way that will have them wanting to discover more about it, wanting to take action, and even benefiting from the opportunities;
											Climate change is often portrayed as all doom and gloom which can be traumatizing for both adults and children; children need to be empowered with the solutions available by educating them on minor changes they can make that impact climate change and become responsible climate citizens;
											The young people acting as a force multiplier will advance the cause of climate change solutions in Nigeria through the school community. Evidence suggests that when young people learn about something, they tend to relay that information to older ones and their parents. Adults (parents) in turn, are more likely to appreciate the risks and urgency of the issue. </p>
